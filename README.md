# Kafka Metrics Demo

You will need to have Python version [TODO] installed. To run the code you will need to be able to run Jupyter Notebooks. 

This is one way to do it.

If you have Python installed you will want to pip install virtualevn so you can run the code. See here for how to work with virtual environments.

Once you have a virtual environment started where you have cloned the repo, use pip to install your requirements. The virtualenv link above will take you through doing this but you can do it with this command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then run the command to start the Jupyter notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Alternatively if you have Anaconda installed you can just navigate the command line to the cloned repo files and do

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
